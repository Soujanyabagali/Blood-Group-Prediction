# Blood Group Prediction from Fingerprints Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict blood groups based on fingerprint images. The system leverages image processing and deep learning techniques to analyze fingerprint patterns and classify them into different blood groups.

## Features
- CNN-based fingerprint image classification
- Web interface for uploading fingerprint images and displaying predicted blood group
- Visualization of results and performance metrics
- User authentication and profile management (if applicable)
- Detailed results and charts for analysis

## Project Structure
- `Code/`: Contains the main application code including the CNN model and web app
- `Code/templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface
- `Results/`: Sample output images and result visualizations
- `Requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Soujanyabagali/Blood-Group-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Blood-Group-Prediction-from-Fingerprints-Using-CNN-main
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r Requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the web application:
   ```
   python Code/app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).
3. Upload fingerprint images to get blood group predictions.
